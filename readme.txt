== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Are you serious? =
Reasonably so. Seeing 'Trash' too often sent me over the edge.

= Why isn't this a mo/po file? =
Since en_GB is quite similar to en_US, it would be rather unnecessary to use full string translations that may require updating for each version.

= Using -ize isn't an Americanism =
While I'm aware of this, I loathe [Oxford spelling](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_and_British_English_spelling_differences#-ise.2C_-ize_.28-isation.2C_-ization.29) with a passion.
